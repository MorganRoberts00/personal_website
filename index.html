				Howdy! My name is Morgan Roberts and I am a Junior Texas A&M University Student who is currently studying
				Computer
				Science in College Station. As an aspiring computer scientist, I have developed a passion for the topics of
				cryptography
				and quantum algorithms and I am excited for what the future holds. My Hobbies include programming,
				travelling, playing
				the guitar, language-learning, and being the loudest and proudest member of the Fightin’ Texas Aggie Class
				of 2023!

				I was born and raised in the small but fast-growing city of Longview, Texas. I attended Longview High School
				where I was
				enrolled in the International Baccalaureate Programme and eventually graduated with both a high school and
				International
				Baccalaureate Diploma. Early on in high school, I accidentally discovered the concept of vectors and
				matrices from a
				video game, which stirred me to study linear algebra outside of school. I discovered the practical
				applications of the
				subject in areas such as physics and computer science and it was fascinating enough to convince me to write
				my high
				school thesis on the application of limits on parametric equations. I can genuinely say that it helped to
				shape my
				current aspirations in the field.

				On top of my academic pursuits, I have a deep interest in music theory and its specific uses on the guitar.
				Although I’m
				still an ameteur guitar player who only recently picked up the instrument, I’ve realized that there is a
				great deal of
				satisfaction in practicing and playing it. Prior to beginning, I hadn’t realized just how applicable music
				theory is as
				well as how mathematically involved it is. I’m eager to continue learning and studying it as a hobby.
